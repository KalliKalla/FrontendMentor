## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM naming methodology
- Self hosted font
- Media query to address both mobile and desktop layouts

### What I learned

Got more comfortable with using the BEM naming methodology. I made an attempt at making my CSS more organised by breaking up the code into sections.

### Continued development

I want to learn to use utility classes to make my code more organised.
