## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design to address both mobile and desktop without media queries
- BEM naming methodology
- Self hosted font

### What I learned

I used clamp in order to make the font scale between viewport sizes. Also usesd pre-defined spacing, based on em, in order to make the spacing change with the font size.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.blog-preview-card__author-name {
  font-size: var(--text-size-3);
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);
  margin-inline-start: var(--spacing-150);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Learning more about responsive design and when to use media queries
- Improving my workflow with CSS preprocessors like Sass
- Better understanding of accessibility best practices

### Useful resources

- [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) - "Can I use" provides up-to-date browser support tables for support of front-end web technologies on desktop and mobile web browsers.
- [Clamp Calculator](https://www.marcbacon.com/tools/clamp-calculator/) - There are a lot of these calculators availbale online. Good for calculating the values to use in your clamp function.
