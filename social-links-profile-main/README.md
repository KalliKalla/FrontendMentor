## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming methodology
- Self hosted font
- Media query to address both mobile and desktop without media queries

### What I learned

Getting more comfortable with analysing Figma designs. I switched to using Chrome dev tools from Firefox. I find them better for viewing margins and padding.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Learning more about responsive design
- Better understanding of accessibility best practices
