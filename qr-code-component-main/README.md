## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox for centering
- Self-hosted fonts (Outfit)
- BEM naming methodology
- Responsive units (rem)
- Fixed-width card design

### What I learned

Through valuable feedback from the Frontend Mentor community, I learned several best practices:

1. **Self-hosting fonts for better performance** - Instead of loading all font weights from Google Fonts, I now self-host only the weights I need (400 and 700), improving load times.

2. **BEM naming methodology** - Adopted the Block Element Modifier naming convention for more maintainable CSS:

```css
.qr-card {
}
.qr-card__image {
}
.qr-card__title {
}
```

3. **CSS Custom Properties** - Implemented variables for colors, spacing, and typography for easier maintenance:

```css
:root {
  --color-bg: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --spacing-sm: 1rem;
  --font-size-title: 1.47rem;
}
```

4. **Responsive units (rem over px)** - Switched from pixels to rem units for better accessibility and scaling.

5. **Preventing layout shifts** - Added width and height attributes to images to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):

```html
<img src="..." alt="..." width="576" height="576" />
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Learning more about responsive design and when to use media queries
- Exploring CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- Improving my workflow with CSS preprocessors like Sass
- Better understanding of accessibility best practices
